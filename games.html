            Island Tapes is the first game I made from beginning to end. It started out as an exercise on implementing audio for an immersive open-world, but I ended up developing a little story for it and even hired a voice actor!
            <p>
            It's a very short walking simulator that can be beaten in around 10 minutes and while barebones I'm happy with the end result for a learning project. It can be downloaded for free <a href="https://ptkstefano.itch.io/island-tapes">here</a>.

            <p>
            Pixel Taxi is a game I'm working on right now about driving a little isometric taxi through a pixel art city. This started as an experiment since I don't think there are really any games with this aesthetic other than maybe Rock n' Roll Racing
            and Power Drive for the SNES and I wanted to see if it could ever work. It turns out to drive really well. Now I'm building a game on top of this mechanic.
            <p>
            There's a lot of work to do but a playable state is somewhere in the horizon!

            I'm Patrick Stefano. I was born and live in Curitiba - Brazil and I'm a recent music graduate from the Federal University from Paran√°.
             I've been a huge computer nerd since always so learning to code feels like the most natural thing. I love games and at first starting learning programming so that I could make my own games, I ended up really liking it and want to build a career out of code!
