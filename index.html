            Welcome to my webpage!
            <p><br>

            I've built this page to satisfy CS50's Problem Set 8 - Homepage. CS50 is Harvard's course in introduction to computer science and it's available for free to everyone on the internet.
            In this particular problem set we are supposed to build a web page with the newly acquired skills in the world of front-end development with the power of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

            <p>

            In the other pages I present a few of my personal projects featuring some games, music and a version of Pong I made in Javascript!

            <p>

            I'd like to express my gratitude to Harvard University, to the lecturer David J. Malan and to CS50's staff for building up this course that shares so much knowledge and that inspires
            it's students around the world to excel and be hungry for knowledge!

            I'm Patrick Stefano. I was born and live in Curitiba - Brazil and I'm a recent music graduate from the Federal University from Paran√°.
             I've been a huge computer nerd since always so learning to code feels like the most natural thing. I love games and at first starting learning programming so that I could make my own games, I ended up really liking it and want to build a career out of code!
